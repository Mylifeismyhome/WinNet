## HOW TO BUILD

### Windows

Requires:
- nasm
- perl
- VC build tools

MYSQL:
To compile WinNet with MYSQL Support, you will have to download the MySQL C++ Connector and place all files in the following directories:
- MYSQL/lib/x64/release/
- MYSQL/lib/x64/debug/
- MYSQL/lib/x86/release/
- MYSQL/lib/x86/debug/

Install and Compile:
1. Run Install.bat inside the Scripts folder.
2. Enter the VC Path (e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019).
3. Enter the Perl path (e.g., C:\Strawberry).
4. Enter the NASM path (e.g., C:\Users\Tobias\AppData\Local\bin\NASM).

> [WARNING]
> Uses 'setx' to set NASM path to the system environment.

### Linux

Build all:
- `make all` (include dependencies)
- `make build`
- `make sandbox`

Build dependencies:
- `make cryptopp`
- `make openssl-download`
- `make openssl-unpack`
- `make openssl-configure`
- `make openssl-build`
- `make openssl-install`
- `make mysql-download`
- `make mysql-install`

Clean:
- `make cryptopp-clean`
- `make openssl-clean`
- `make mysql-clean`

Clean all:
- `make clean`

Build:
- `make netcore`
- `make netclient`
- `make netserver`
- `make netwebsocket`

Build sandbox:
- `make sandboxclient`
- `make sandboxserver`
- `make sandboxwebsocket`
- `make sandboxfeatures` (use it to test functionality of NetCore Features)
